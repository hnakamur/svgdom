****************************************************************************
I discontinued this project because I decided to use the jQuery SVG plugin
by Mr. Keith Wood.

svgdom - A SVG DOM manipulator which is easy to use for common tasks.
It is aimed at using with svgweb (http://svgweb.googlecode.com/).

Goals:
- Make it easy to use for common cases.
  - Let it hard but doable for other cases.

- Produce compact svg dom xml.
  - Avoid redundant elements and attributes.
  - Prefer shorter attribute values.
    - But avoid too short unreadable values.

API naming policy:
- Short names for convenient methods.
- Long names for primitive operations.
  - Reserve short names for the future when you add more convenient methods.
- Evolutionary API growth.
  - Do not add convenient methods until you find actual use cases.
